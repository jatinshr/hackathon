IDEA
So, We have created a platform where people can come and post any issue that either they are facing or anything that they think is unjust , they can post it in our  platform and let their voices be heard by the masses , and that too being fully ananomous . Apart from that we also act as an interface between the user facing the issue and the ngo’s and welfare socities that are related to that cause .The issue can be anything are everything ranging from let’s say the lack a proper waste management system in your locality to speaking against child labour. You are a citizen of  the largest democracy and you deserve to let your voice be heard.

WORKING
First you go to the site and post the issue must be dealt with. We take your details just for the sake of communication as nothing is made public except your  content that you write. Once you have written your issue , our team contacts via through mail and try to get a grasp of the  situation. Once received a sufficient amount of proof of your claim , we dispatch our inspection team to look at the situation . If your claims are found to be true , we start engaging with the respective ngo’s and welfare societies to help you and your locality with the issue.
